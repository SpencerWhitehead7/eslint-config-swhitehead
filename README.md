# eslint-config

Personal config for projects

This is very much a maximalist config; I tried to set every current, non-deprecated core JS rule, every React rule, and it also uses the React Hooks plugin. This means it also does all code style/formatting, and does not use Prettier. The settings are pretty custom and while I personally like them, for a production project I would use something more standard, like Google or Airbnb's configs, with Prettier. I created and posted this so I could share it across projects/machines, since eslint is in the process of deprecating `/~` level configs, and it's not really intended to be public.
